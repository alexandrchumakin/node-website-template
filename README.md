# nodeWebsiteTemplate
A NodeJS app template useful to build simple websites

This little project is intended to help node js beginners to build their 
websites with an express api in charge of serving the pages and also provide
the needed configuration to work with the [EcmaScript 6 features] (http://es6-features.org/#Constants).

TDD is a must today and many folks like me are trying to find a complete and simple tool to use this
approach, this project is configured with [tape](https://github.com/substack/tape) and includes an 
example.

This kind of template should not be used to big apps, in that case you 
should use a complete framework like [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and even simplier, 
a great tool like [Create react app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
